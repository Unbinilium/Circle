## Circle

An simple FIFO ringbuffer written using C++, initial by a typename  `T` and unsigned integer `capacity` of ringbuffer, it will overwrites the old item(s) that pushing while ringbuffer is full.

```cpp
template<typename T, size_t capacity> class ringbuffer
```

- `bool push_head(const T& item)` - Pushing an new item on ringbuffer head by lvalue reference, return if it overwrites an item.

- `bool push_head(T&& item)` - Pushing an new item on ringbuffer head by copy construction, return if it overwrites an item.

- `T catch_tail(void)` - Get an item from ringbuffer tail, return the default initialized type T if ringbuffer is empty, and keeps the buffer in the ringbuffer if there had no overwrite action has been performed.

- `size_t size(void)` - Get current catchable item counts from ringbuffer.

- `bool is_empty(void)` - Check if ringbuffer is empty, empty for true, otherwise for false.

- `bool is_full(void)` - Check if ringbuffer is full, full for true, otherwise for false.

- `void empty(void)` - Empty all buffer(s) inside ringbuffer, not free the memory, only reset the ringbuffers pointer position.
